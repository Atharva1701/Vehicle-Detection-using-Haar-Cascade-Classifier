# Vehicle-Detection-using-Haar-Cascade-Classifier
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.  Here, a small classifier is trained to detect vehicles in a video frame. About 120 negative images were used and 6 positive images were used.
